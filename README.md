# Hide And Seek Extreme Script - Find All Players, Grab Coins, ESP



A roblox hide and seek extreme script is a piece of Lua code injected into the game using an executor, allowing you to automate tasks and gain advantages over other players. These scripts are used primarily by those who want a more efficient or fun experience, especially in large maps where finding players manually can be challenging.

Take your gameplay to the next level with our open-source project designed for both casual users and advanced scripters.
